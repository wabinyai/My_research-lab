Getis-Ord Gi* statistic, is used to measure spatial autocorrelation and identify hot-spots (clusters of high attribute levels) and cold-spots (clusters of low attribute levels) with varying of significance.

Local Moran’s I is a local spatial autocorrelation statistic proposed by Anselin as a way to
identify local clusters and outliers. In python this function is realized by the Cluster and Outlier
Analysis (Anselin Local Moran’s I) tool. The local Moran’s I is given as Eq:
