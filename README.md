The Getis-Ord Local Statistic, also known as the Local Moran's I, is a spatial statistics technique used to identify clusters of high or low values within a geographic dataset. This statistical method was developed by Arthur Getis and J. Keith Ord and is widely used in spatial analysis and geographic information systems (GIS) to reveal patterns of spatial autocorrelation.
